//! `Scoring_Engine` — three-dimensional classification, inflation index, weighted sum.
//!
//! This module implements the design's *三维评分计算流程 (Scoring Computation Flow)*.
//! It is built up across three sequential tasks in this same file:
//!
//! - **Task 8.1:** dimension classification + proportion validation
//!   ([`ScoringEngine::classify`]).
//! - **Task 8.2:** inflation-index configuration & range validation
//!   ([`InflationIndexConfig`] + [`InflationIndexConfig::set_inflation_index`]) plus the
//!   governance-gated change seam ([`InflationIndexConfig::apply_governed_change`]).
//! - **Task 8.3 (this task):** weighted mint-amount sum
//!   ([`ScoringEngine::compute_mint_amount`]) over a [`BaseScores`] map.
//!
//! Tasks 8.2 and 8.3 append to this file without disturbing the classification logic
//! implemented in task 8.1.

    ///   present in `weights` **must** have a base score; a missing base score for a
    ///   present dimension is malformed input and is rejected with
