//! `Chain_Registry` — derivation tree, lifecycle, and `(parentId, domain)` uniqueness.
//!
//! This module implements the **data model** for the GMC derivation tree (design's
//! *Data Models → Chain_Registry 派生树* section) plus its `(parentId, domain)`
//! uniqueness index. It is the storage/accessor foundation that the later registry
//! tasks build on:
//!
//! - task 2.1 (this task): the [`NestedMeritChain`] record, the [`ChainRegistry`]
//!   container with the `(parentId, domain)` index, the `GMC_Base` depth-0 root, and
//!   the insert/lookup/accessor scaffolding.
//! - task 2.2: the `derive` validation algorithm (parent-exists → no-cycle →
//!   depth ≤ 16 → `(parent, domain)` unique) and the `detectCycle` guard.
//! - task 2.3: `getPath`, `setLifecycle`, and `resolveEvaluationMechanism`
//!   (inheritance up the derivation path).
//!
//! ## Field mapping (design Data Models)
//!
//! `NestedMeritChain` mirrors the design record `id / parentId / domain / path /
//! depth / stewards / originType / createdAt / lifecycle / evaluationMechanism /
//! config`. Two fields reference types owned by *other* protocol modules that are
//! authored concurrently (the `Evaluation_Mechanism` lives in `mechanism`, the quota
//! / inflation config in `quota` / `scoring`). To keep this crate compiling without a
//! premature cross-module dependency, those two fields are typed here as the local,
//! opaque placeholders [`EvaluationMechanismRef`] and [`ChainConfigRef`]. Tasks 2.3 /
//! 5.x / 6.x wire the concrete types in once those modules land.
//!
//! ## Requirements covered by task 2.1
//!
//! - **Requirement 1.1**: `GMC_Base` is the depth-0 root recording top-level
//!   contribution categories — see [`ChainRegistry::with_root`] / [`NestedMeritChain::root`].
//! - **Requirement 1.4**: every chain records its domain id, parent id and creation
//!   time — the corresponding [`NestedMeritChain`] fields.
//! - **Requirement 2.4**: every nested chain carries at least one Steward — enforced
//!   at construction by [`NestedMeritChain::new`].
//! - **Requirement 2.9** (uniqueness index foundation): the `(parentId, domain)`
//!   index in [`ChainRegistry`]; full ordered-validation `derive` is task 2.2.
