//! `L1_Settlement` — pure-logic model of the Substrate L1 settlement layer.
//!
//! Per the design's *L1/L2 分层架构集成* section, the **L1_Settlement** layer is a
//! Substrate专用链 responsible for settlement & consensus. It stores the protocol's
//! low-frequency, strong-finality state and is the anchoring target for the seams
//! left across the pure-logic modules (registry, mechanism, scoring, minting,
//! retroactive, anti-fraud). This module is the **concrete home** for those seams.
//!
//! ## Why this is a pure-logic abstraction (not a Substrate pallet)
//!
//! `gmc-core` is intentionally dependency-free (task 1.1): it must compile and be
//! testable without any Substrate / FRAME runtime crates so the very same logic can be
//! reused by both the L1 pallet and the L2 rollup. Accordingly this module models
//! **what L1 stores and the anchoring operations it performs** as an in-memory data
//! structure ([`L1Settlement`]) with documented seams. The real Substrate pallet is a
//! thin wrapper: it persists this same record set into on-chain storage, charges no
//! transaction fee (Requirement 13.4), and runs GRANDPA/BABE consensus
//! (Requirement 13.6). Where this module says "model" / "stand-in", the production
//! pallet substitutes the corresponding chain primitive (real cryptographic state
//! root, real storage maps, real consensus engine).
//!
//! ## What L1 stores (Requirement 13.1)
//!
//! [`L1Settlement`] holds, exactly as the requirement enumerates:
//!
//! - **功勋链注册记录** — [`ChainRegistrationRecord`], keyed by [`ChainId`].
//! - **身份注册记录** — [`IdentityRegistrationRecord`], keyed by [`FayID`].
//! - **治理投票结果** — [`VoteResultRecord`], keyed by vote id.
//! - **惩罚记录** — an append-only log of [`PenaltyRecord`].
//! - **状态根** — the current [`StateRoot`] (a model stand-in; see that type).
//!
//! It additionally keeps an append-only [`AnchorEntry`] audit log so every anchoring
//! event (and the state root it produced) is traceable.
//!
//! ## Anchoring operations (锚定)
//!
//! "锚定" = commit a settled fact to L1. Two flavours:
//!
//! 1. **Record-anchoring** — store a record *and* advance the model state root
//!    (because the root commits to all L1 state): [`anchor_chain_creation`] (Req 2.6),
//!    [`anchor_mechanism_change`] (Req 3.8), [`anchor_inflation_index_change`]
//!    (Req 7.7), [`anchor_retroactive_outcome`] (Req 10.7),
//!    [`store_identity_registration`] (Req 13.1), [`record_penalty`] (Req 13.1).
//! 2. **Explicit-root anchoring** — set the state root to a caller-supplied value:
//!    [`anchor_derivation_state_root`] (Req 5.1, the `Chain_Registry` 派生关系状态根)
//!    and [`update_state_root`] (Req 8.6, the L2/ZK post-batch state root).
//!
//! [`anchor_chain_creation`]: L1Settlement::anchor_chain_creation
//! [`anchor_mechanism_change`]: L1Settlement::anchor_mechanism_change
//! [`anchor_inflation_index_change`]: L1Settlement::anchor_inflation_index_change
//! [`anchor_retroactive_outcome`]: L1Settlement::anchor_retroactive_outcome
//! [`store_identity_registration`]: L1Settlement::store_identity_registration
//! [`record_penalty`]: L1Settlement::record_penalty
//! [`anchor_derivation_state_root`]: L1Settlement::anchor_derivation_state_root
//! [`update_state_root`]: L1Settlement::update_state_root
//!
//! ## ZK proof verification guard (task 18.2 — Requirement 13.8)
//!
//! The ZK-proof **verification** guard — verify a batch proof, update the state root to
//! the batch root on success, and reject / retain the previous root on failure — is
//! implemented by [`submit_batch_proof`](L1Settlement::submit_batch_proof). It models a
//! batch proof with [`BatchProof`] and verifies it *above* the unconditional
//! [`update_state_root`](L1Settlement::update_state_root): on success it advances the
//! confirmed root to the batch root; on failure it returns
//! [`GmcError::ProofVerificationFailed`] and leaves the previous confirmed root unchanged
//! (Property 30).
