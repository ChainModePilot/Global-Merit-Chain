//! End-to-end flow wiring — composes the protocol modules into the design's four key
//! flows (task 20.1).
//!
//! Every other module in this crate is an independently-implemented, independently-
//! tested building block that deliberately avoids importing its siblings (so each one
//! could be authored and compiled in isolation). The price of that decoupling is that,
//! on their own, the modules look like *isolated, un-integrated code*: the seams they
//! left for one another (the `RegistrationLookup` trait, the `GrantContext` trait, the
//! `L1ProofSink` trait, the L1 anchoring entry points, the carbon `convert` quota
//! charge) are never actually joined up.
//!
//! This module is that join. It owns the cross-module **trait bridges** and the four
//! **flow functions** that thread a contribution all the way through the system,
//! demonstrating that every module connects to the next:
//!
//! - **Flow 1 — 功勋链派生 (chain derivation).** [`run_chain_creation`] runs one of the
//!   three `chain_creation::ChainCreationService` channels → `registry::ChainRegistry`
//!   derivation → `l1_settlement::L1Settlement::anchor_chain_creation` (Req 2.6).
//! - **Flow 2 — 登记 → 记录 → 授予 (register → record → grant).**
//!   [`run_register_record_grant`] runs `registration::RegistrationService::register`
//!   → `recording::RecordingService::record` (via the [`RegistrationLookupBridge`]) →
//!   the three-condition grant guard (via the [`RecordGrantContext`] bridge) →
//!   `scoring::ScoringEngine` → `minting::MintingService` into a `merit::MeritPocket`
//!   with a `quota::QuotaLedger` (Req 9.5/9.8).
//! - **Flow 3 — 事后申报审核投票 (retroactive review / voting).**
//!   [`run_retroactive_review`] runs `retroactive::RetroactiveReviewModule::submit` →
//!   `antifraud::select_voters` → `governance::GovernanceModule` weighted tally →
//!   `retroactive::RetroactiveReviewModule::resolve_vote`, minting on approval and
//!   anchoring the outcome via `l1_settlement` (Req 10.5/10.6).
//! - **Flow 4 — 碳积分转 MeriToken (carbon → MeriToken).** [`run_carbon_conversion`]
//!   runs `carbon::CarbonCreditVoucher::import_to_retroactive_flow` → the flow-3
//!   review/vote → on approval, `carbon::CarbonCreditVoucher::convert` (charge the env
//!   chain's Refresh_Period quota + mark the voucher converted) plus the pocket mint
//!   (Req 12.2).
//!
//! In addition, [`anchor_rollup_batch`] wires the **L2 → L1** boundary end-to-end
//! (Req 9.7) through the [`L1SettlementProofSink`] bridge, so the `l2_rollup` batch
//! machinery connects to `l1_settlement`'s ZK-proof verification guard.
//!
//! ## Composition only — no re-implemented logic
//!
//! This module calls existing public APIs and never re-implements module logic. The
//! only "new" code here is (a) the three trait bridges the modules left seams for and
//! (b) the orchestration that sequences the existing calls. No accessor was added to
//! any other module: every fact a flow needs is already exposed.
