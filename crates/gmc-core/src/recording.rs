//! `Recording_Service` — contribution recording and registration matching.
//!
//! This module implements task 11.2: recording a concrete contribution behaviour
//! *after* a merit has been registered, and wiring the evaluation-result mark back
//! onto the stored record. It realises the design's `Recording_Service` interface
//! (`record` / `markEvaluationResult`) and the standard-flow state machine
//! `Registered → Recorded → Evaluating → Passed | Failed`.
//!
//! ## Requirements covered by task 11.2
//!
//! - **Requirement 9.3**: when a contribution is submitted *and* a matching **valid**
//!   registration exists (same `contributorId`, same `chainId`, registration status
//!   `Valid`), a [`ContributionRecord`] is created and **linked** to that
//!   registration (its [`ContributionRecord::registration_id`] is `Some`). The new
//!   record starts in [`EvaluationStatus::Pending`].
//! - **Requirement 9.4**: when no matching valid registration exists **and** the
//!   request is not flowing through the retroactive-declaration path, the record is
//!   rejected with [`GmcError::NotRegistered`] and nothing is written.
//! - **Requirement 9.6**: [`RecordingService::mark_evaluation_result`] with
//!   `passed = false` **retains** the record and marks it
//!   [`EvaluationStatus::Failed`] ("认定未通过"); it mints nothing. (Minting itself
//!   is owned by `Minting_Service`; this module only records the verdict.)
//!
//! ## Decoupling from `Registration_Service` (the `RegistrationLookup` seam)
//!
//! Whether a "matching valid registration exists" is a fact owned by the
//! `Registration_Service` (`src/registration.rs`, task 11.1). To keep this module
//! independently compilable and free of a cross-module dependency on a concurrently
//! authored file, `Recording_Service` does **not** import the concrete registration
//! types. Instead it depends on the [`RegistrationLookup`] **trait defined here**,
//! which it owns. The integration task (20.1) implements [`RegistrationLookup`] over
//! the real `RegistrationService` (its `findValidRegistration`) and passes it in.
//!
//! The trait's primary method returns the *id* of a matching valid registration
//! ([`RegistrationLookup::find_valid_registration`]) so the new record can be linked
//! to it (Requirement 9.3); the boolean convenience
//! [`RegistrationLookup::has_valid_registration`] is provided as a default on top.
//!
//! ## Retroactive path (Requirement 9.4, delegated to task 15.x)
//!
//! When `is_retroactive` is `true`, a missing registration is **not** an error: the
//! retroactive-declaration flow (`Retroactive_Review_Module`, task 15.x) is the
//! authority for such records, and the contribution record it produces is **not**
//! linked to a registration (its `registration_id` is `None`, matching the design
//! data model `registrationId: string | null`). Here we only allow such a record to
//! be created; the stricter retroactive evidence checks and voting live in task 15.x.
//!
//! ## L2 rollup batch seam (Requirement 9.7, task 19.1)
//!
//! Per the design, `Recording_Service` runs on L2 and submits a batched
//! zero-knowledge proof of recorded contributions to L1 (`submitRollupBatch`). That
//! ZK/L2 machinery is **not** implemented in this pure-logic core; it is wired by the
//! L2 integration task (19.1). The records stored here are the input that batching
//! will later consume — see [`RecordingService::iter`].
