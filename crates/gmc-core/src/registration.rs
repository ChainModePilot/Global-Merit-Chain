//! `Registration_Service` — merit registration and grant-trigger guards.
//!
//! This module implements the **standard "登记 → 记录 → 授予" intake stage**: a
//! contributor first *registers* an intended contribution on-chain before any
//! recording or minting happens (design's *Registration_Service* section, and the
//! *Data Models → 登记记录* record). It owns:
//!
//! - [`RegistrationStatus`] — the lifecycle of a registration (`Valid` / `Consumed`
//!   / `Revoked`), initialized to `Valid` on a successful application.
//! - [`Registration`] — the immutable登记记录 (`id / contributorId / chainId /
//!   description / registeredAt / status`).
//! - [`RegistrationApplication`] — the input to [`RegistrationService::register`].
//! - [`RegistrationService`] — the store of registrations plus the validating
//!   `register` entry point and the [`find_valid_registration`] lookup that the
//!   `Recording_Service` (task 11.2) relies on.
//!
//! ## Field validation (this task, 11.1 — Requirements 9.1, 9.2)
//!
//! [`RegistrationService::register`] accepts an application **iff** it carries a
//! non-empty contributor id, a non-empty chain id, and a description of at most
//! **2000 characters** (counted as Unicode *characters*, not bytes — "字" = chars).
//! The登记时间 (`registered_at`) is a value-typed [`Timestamp`] and so is always
//! present by construction. On success a [`Registration`] with `status = Valid` is
//! created, stored, and its [`RegistrationId`] returned. On **any** validation
//! failure the call returns [`GmcError::FieldValidation`] and creates **nothing**
//! (no partial write — the design's "validate up front, fail atomically, state
//! unchanged" principle).
//!
//! ## Lookup for the recording stage (Requirement 9.3 support)
//!
//! [`RegistrationService::find_valid_registration`] returns the registration whose
//! `contributorId` *and* `chainId` match the query *and* whose `status` is `Valid`.
//! `Recording_Service` (task 11.2) calls this to answer "is there a matching valid
//! registration?" without coupling to this module's internals.
//!
//! ## Grant three-condition guard (this task, 11.3 — Requirements 9.5, 9.8)
//!
//! The授予 (grant) guard fires minting **iff** all three conditions hold at once
//! (_Requirement 9.8_): a *matching valid registration* exists ∧ an *associated
//! contribution record* exists ∧ that record *passed evaluation*. This is realised by:
//!
//! - [`can_grant`] — the **pure three-condition predicate** (the design's `canGrant`).
//!   It takes the registration (as an `Option`, re-checking validity defensively) plus
//!   the two contribution-derived booleans, and returns `true` only when all three are
//!   true. This is the canonical AND that Property 20 (task 11.6) exercises across the
//!   full boolean truth table.
//! - [`GrantContext`] — a tiny trait **owned by this module** that abstracts the two
//!   contribution-derived facts (`has_linked_record` / `evaluation_passed`). It keeps
//!   `Registration_Service` decoupled from `recording.rs`'s concrete types (which are
//!   authored separately), mirroring how `Recording_Service` owns its
//!   `RegistrationLookup` trait rather than importing this module.
//! - [`RegistrationService::can_grant`] — the single integration entry point. It
//!   supplies condition 1 itself via [`find_valid_registration`] and combines it with
//!   the [`GrantContext`] facts, so the wiring task (20.1) calls one method.
//!
//! > **Minting wiring (_Requirement 9.5_).** This guard is only the *gate*: when
//! > [`RegistrationService::can_grant`] returns `true`, the integration layer (task
//! > 20.1) is responsible for invoking `Minting_Service.mint` (mint only once the
//! > record passes evaluation). The actual `Minting_Service` call is intentionally
//! > **not** made here, to keep this pure-logic core free of cross-module coupling.
//!
//! ## Seams left for later tasks
//!
//! - **L1 state-root anchoring (Requirement 9.1).** The登记状态根 must be anchored to
//!   `L1_Settlement`. Real anchoring is the infrastructure task 18.1; this module
//!   leaves the documented seam [`RegistrationService::anchor_registration_root`]
//!   (a pure-logic no-op placeholder) so the wiring point is explicit.
//! - **`GrantContext` implementation over real records (Requirement 9.8).** The
//!   integration task (20.1) implements [`GrantContext`] over the real
//!   `ContributionRecord` (`recording.rs`): `has_linked_record` ← `record.is_linked()`
//!   and `evaluation_passed` ← `record.evaluation_status() == Passed`.
