//! Unified, machine-identifiable error codes for the GMC pure-logic core.
//!
//! Per the design's *Error Handling* section, error handling follows a single
//! principle: **validate up front, fail atomically, leave state unchanged, return a
//! machine-identifiable code**. Every rejected request must produce *no* partial
//! write (no side effects) and return one of the [`GmcError`] variants below.
//!
//! Each variant is annotated with its triggering condition and the requirement /
//! design "Error Handling" table row it maps to. The variants are intentionally
//! data-light at this stage (task 1.2 defines the shared error vocabulary); richer
//! per-variant payloads can be added by the modules that own each rule in later
//! tasks without changing the variant set.
