//! Nested merit-chain creation channels — the three ways a `Nested_Merit_Chain`
//! can be brought into existence (design *Requirement 2* / sequence *流程 1：功勋链派生*).
//!
//! Requirement 2 defines **three** initiation channels, each of which — when its
//! upstream gate is satisfied — ends in a single [`ChainRegistry::derive`] call that
//! runs the design's ordered derivation validation (parent exists → no cycle →
//! depth ≤ 16 → `(parent, domain)` unique) and records an [`OriginType`]:
//!
//! 1. **投票发起 / vote-initiated** ([`ChainCreationService::create_by_vote`]): a
//!    creation *proposal* reached the chain's governance threshold
//!    (_Requirement 2.1_). The weighted-tally decision is produced by the
//!    `Governance_Module`; this service consumes the resulting boolean. On a passing
//!    vote it derives with [`OriginType::VoteInitiated`].
//! 2. **主理人发起 / steward-initiated** ([`ChainCreationService::create_by_steward`]):
//!    a *qualified* Steward submitted the request (_Requirement 2.2_). An entity that
//!    lacks steward qualification is rejected with [`GmcError::StewardNotQualified`]
//!    and **nothing is created** (_Requirement 2.7_). On a qualified request it
//!    derives with [`OriginType::StewardInitiated`].
//! 3. **机构申请 / institution-applied** ([`ChainCreationService::create_by_institution`]):
//!    an institution's creation application *passed review* (_Requirement 2.3_). An
//!    application that failed review is rejected with
//!    [`GmcError::InstitutionReviewFailed`] and **nothing is created**
//!    (_Requirement 2.8_). On a passing review it derives with
//!    [`OriginType::InstitutionApplied`].
//!
//! ## Decisions are inputs, not computed here
//!
//! The governance tally (_Req 2.1_), the steward-qualification check (_Req 2.7_) and
//! the institution review (_Req 2.8_) are performed by other modules / the
//! integration layer (`Governance_Module`, identity / qualification services,
//! institutional review). This service is the **pure-logic choke point** that turns
//! each already-made decision into either a derivation (recording the right
//! `originType`) or an atomic rejection. Modelling each decision as a plain `bool`
//! keeps the channel logic deterministic and trivially testable.
//!
//! ## Missing field handling (_Requirement 2.5_)
//!
//! A creation request that omits its parent-chain id or its domain id must be
//! rejected with [`GmcError::MissingField`] and create nothing. Rather than
//! duplicate that check, every channel (once its gate passes) defers to
//! [`ChainRegistry::derive`], which performs the `MissingField` check as the *first*
//! step of its ordered validation. This keeps the missing-field behaviour identical
//! across all three channels and consistent with plain derivation.
//!
//! ## Atomicity & ordering
//!
//! Each channel first consults its upstream gate; a failed gate returns the mapped
//! error **before** any registry mutation, so a rejected request leaves the registry
//! completely unchanged ("validate up front, fail atomically, state unchanged"). When
//! the gate passes, [`ChainRegistry::derive`] is itself atomic, so any derivation-time
//! rejection (`MissingField` / `ParentNotFound` / `CycleConflict` / `DepthExceeded` /
//! `DomainConflict`) likewise leaves the registry untouched.
//!
//! > **L1 anchoring note (_Requirement 2.6_):** the creation record is anchored to L1
//! > via `L1Settlement::anchor_chain_creation` (task 18.1) and wired end-to-end by the
//! > flow-wiring task (20.1). This module performs only the pure-logic gate + derive;
//! > it intentionally does not depend on `l1_settlement`.
