//! Quota & refresh-period accounting (per-chain isolation, one-time vs periodic).
//!
//! This module owns the **data model** and **configuration validation** for the
//! per-chain minting quota described in the design's *Quota Accounting* section
//! (Requirements 4.1, 4.8). Each `Nested_Merit_Chain` carries an independent
//! [`QuotaConfig`] (how much may be minted and how the allowance refreshes) and an
//! independent [`QuotaLedger`] (how much has been minted so far this period).
//!
//! The data model & configuration validation (task 6.1):
//!
//! - [`TimeUnit`] / [`RefreshPeriod`] — the refresh-cadence model: a chain is either
//!   `OneTime` (a single non-renewing allowance) or `Periodic` with an explicit time
//!   unit and a strictly-positive interval value.
//! - [`QuotaConfig`] — a validating constructor that accepts a config *iff* the quota
//!   is a strictly-positive (finite) [`Decimal`] **and** the refresh period is valid;
//!   otherwise it returns [`GmcError::QuotaConfigInvalid`].
//! - [`QuotaLedger`] — the per-period accounting record, initialized with
//!   `minted_this_period = 0` and `exhausted = false`.
//!
//! Quota checking, consumption & per-chain isolation (**this task, 6.2**):
//!
//! - [`QuotaLedger::check_quota`] — answers "would a mint of `amount` be allowed?"
//!   without mutating anything. A mint is allowed *iff* the ledger is not exhausted
//!   **and** `minted_this_period + amount <= quota` (Requirements 4.2, 4.3).
//! - [`QuotaLedger::consume_quota`] — re-checks then, on success, accumulates `amount`
//!   into `minted_this_period` (Requirement 4.4). A rejected request leaves the
//!   counter **unchanged** (Requirement 4.3). A `OneTime` chain that fully consumes
//!   its quota is flagged [`exhausted`](QuotaLedger::is_exhausted) and thereafter
//!   rejects every request, never restoring quota (Requirements 4.2, 4.7).
//! - [`QuotaLedgerSet`] — an optional registry keyed by [`ChainId`] that holds one
//!   independent `(QuotaConfig, QuotaLedger)` pair per chain and routes
//!   check/consume to the right ledger, so consuming on one chain can never touch
//!   another chain's allowance (Requirement 4.6, per-chain isolation).
//!
//! Refresh-period rollover / reset (**this task, 6.3**):
//!
//! - [`RefreshPeriod::period_length_secs`] — the length of one period in whole
//!   seconds (`unit.seconds() × value`), or `None` for `OneTime`. The interval
//!   `value` is a [`Decimal`] but is interpreted as a whole count of units: any
//!   fractional part is truncated toward zero (the design expects an integer count).
//! - [`QuotaLedger::reset`] — the low-level primitive that starts a fresh period:
//!   sets `minted_this_period = 0` and `period_start = now`.
//! - [`QuotaLedger::reset_if_elapsed`] — the time-based rollover (Requirement 4.5):
//!   for a **non-one-time** (`Periodic`) chain, once a full `Refresh_Period` has
//!   elapsed since `period_start` it resets `minted_this_period` to 0 and advances
//!   `period_start` to the boundary of the period that now contains `now`. `OneTime`
//!   chains never refresh (no-op). Calling it again **within** the same period does
//!   nothing, so accumulation is preserved until a real boundary is crossed.
//! - [`QuotaLedgerSet::reset_if_elapsed`] — routes the rollover to a single chain's
//!   ledger, mirroring [`check`](QuotaLedgerSet::check)/[`consume`](QuotaLedgerSet::consume).
//!
//! > Note that [`consume_quota`](QuotaLedger::consume_quota) still only accumulates
//! > *within* the current period — it never resets. Callers advance periods by
//! > invoking `reset_if_elapsed` (typically at the start of a mint, with the current
//! > on-chain time) before checking/consuming quota.
//! >
//! > Note on "finite": [`Decimal`] is an `i128`-backed fixed-point type, so every
//! > representable value is inherently finite (there is no NaN/∞). The "finite"
//! > clause of Requirements 4.1/4.8 is therefore satisfied by construction, and the
//! > only positive-value check that remains meaningful is `quota > 0`.
