//! MeritPocket / Merit batch model: per-batch exponential decay and the
//! `minMerit` floor value (blueprint chapter 04, _Requirements 8.1, 8.4, 8.5_).
//!
//! This module owns the *data model* and *decay math* of the MeriToken economy:
//!
//! - [`MeritBatch`] — one minting event. It records the acquisition amount `V`
//!   (`> 0`), this batch's contribution `B` to the floor value, the decay
//!   coefficient `lambda` (`λ = k / influenceDuration`), the `influence_duration`
//!   (`> 0`), the on-chain acquisition time and the source chain id
//!   (_Requirement 8.1_).
//! - [`MeritPocket`] — the container bound to a [`FayID`]. It holds the floor value
//!   `min_merit` (initialised to `e ≈ 2.718281`) plus the list of active batches.
//!
//! ## Single-batch decay (_Requirement 8.4_, blueprint 4.4)
//!
//! Each batch decays *independently* per the blueprint formula
//!
//! ```text
//! MeriToken_i(t) = (V_i − B_i) · e^(−λ_i · t) + B_i
//! ```
//!
//! where `t` is the elapsed time (in seconds) since the batch was acquired. The
//! current total is the sum over all active batches:
//!
//! ```text
//! curMerit(t) = Σ_i MeriToken_i(t)
//! ```
//!
//! ## Deterministic `e^(−x)` approximation
//!
//! [`Decimal`] is a fixed-point integer type (`i128` scaled by `10^6`) with no
//! native `exp()`. Because the MeriToken state must reproduce **bit-identically**
//! across the L1 pallet and the L2 rollup, this module computes `e^(−y)` purely
//! with deterministic `i128` arithmetic — no `f64`, no platform math libraries.
//!
//! For `y ≥ 0` we compute the well-conditioned, strictly-increasing forward series
//!
//! ```text
//! e^y = Σ_{k≥0} y^k / k!
//! ```
//!
//! using a numerically stable recurrence `term_k = term_{k−1} · y / k` (this avoids
//! ever materialising a large `y^k` or `k!`), and then return the reciprocal
//! `e^(−y) = 1 / e^y`. Using the *forward* series and reciprocating (rather than the
//! alternating series for `e^(−y)` directly) avoids catastrophic cancellation and,
//! because `e^y` is strictly increasing in `y`, makes `e^(−y)` **non-increasing**
//! in `y` up to fixed-point truncation. Two clamps bound the work and the range:
//!
//! - `y ≤ 0` ⇒ returns `1` (the decay domain is `y = λ·t ≥ 0`; this is the `t = 0`
//!   identity).
//! - `y ≥ 30` ⇒ returns `0`. `e^(−30) ≈ 9.4e−14`, far below the `10^−6` resolution
//!   of [`Decimal`], so the batch has fully decayed to its floor `B_i`. This also
//!   keeps `e^y` well within `i128` range.
//!
//! The series is summed until a term truncates to zero at the fixed-point
//! resolution (guarded by [`MAX_EXP_ITERS`]). Every step uses the crate's checked
//! fixed-point ops, so the result is identical on every platform.
//!
//! ## Monotonicity & lower bound
//!
//! With `e^(−y)` non-increasing in `y` and `y = λ·t` non-decreasing in `t` (for
//! `λ ≥ 0`), each batch's value is non-increasing in `t`. Since `e^(−y) ∈ [0, 1]`
//! for `y ≥ 0`, the value stays within `[B_i, V_i]` and converges to `B_i` as
//! `t → ∞` — the per-batch floor.
//!
//! ## Seam for later tasks
//!
//! This file implements the pocket/batch data model, the decay math, the `curMerit`
//! summation (task 9.1) **and** the `minMerit` floor-update rule
//! `B' = (x + M)·B / M` together with the `curMerit ≥ minMerit` invariant helper
//! (task 9.2). The full `Minting_Service` pipeline — which orders the steps
//! "validate `amount > 0` → check quota → create batch → update `minMerit` →
//! accumulate quota" — is task 9.3 (`src/minting.rs`); it calls
//! [`MeritPocket::update_min_merit`] in that order. The [`E`] constant and the
//! [`MeritBatch::lambda_from_duration`] helper are provided here for those tasks to
//! reuse.
