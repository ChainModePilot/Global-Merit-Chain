//! `Retroactive_Review_Module` — retroactive declaration intake, evidence checks & voting.
//!
//! This module implements **tasks 15.1 + 15.2**:
//!
//! - **Task 15.1 (intake):** receiving a [`RetroactiveDeclaration`] for a contribution
//!   that already happened but was never registered up front, validating its required
//!   fields and the *replayability* of its evidence, and — only when those checks pass
//!   — storing it with review status [`ReviewStatus::Pending`].
//! - **Task 15.2 (threshold + voting):** applying the stricter retroactive pass
//!   threshold [`retro_threshold`] (`max(regular, 2/3)`, strictly above the regular
//!   threshold) and resolving an already-tallied stakeholder vote into
//!   [`ReviewStatus::Approved`] (mint downstream) or [`ReviewStatus::Rejected`] (no
//!   mint), with a placeholder seam to anchor the outcome to L1.
//!
//! It realises the design's `Retroactive_Review_Module` (see the design's *Components
//! and Interfaces* / *Data Models* sections and flow 3, "事后申报审核投票").
//!
//! ## Requirements covered
//!
//! Task 15.1 (intake):
//!
//! - **Requirement 10.1**: when a declaration carries a contributor id, a chain id, a
//!   description of the already-occurred contribution, an occurrence time, **and** a
//!   replayable evidence reference, a declaration record is created with review status
//!   "待审核" ([`ReviewStatus::Pending`]).
//! - **Requirement 10.2**: every declaration must carry **at least one** replayable
//!   evidence reference that points to an on-chain record or external verifiable
//!   record a reviewer can **independently access and verify**.
//! - **Requirement 10.8**: if no evidence reference passes replayability validation
//!   (none present, or none independently accessible/verifiable), the declaration is
//!   rejected with [`GmcError::EvidenceInvalid`] and is **not** pushed into the voting
//!   flow.
//!
//! Task 15.2 (threshold + voting):
//!
//! - **Requirement 10.3**: the retroactive threshold is
//!   `retro = max(regular, 2/3)` and **strictly greater** than the regular threshold
//!   (see [`retro_threshold`]).
//! - **Requirement 10.5**: when the weighted approval is below the retro threshold the
//!   declaration is marked [`ReviewStatus::Rejected`] and **no MeriToken is minted**.
//! - **Requirement 10.6**: when the weighted approval reaches the retro threshold the
//!   declaration is marked [`ReviewStatus::Approved`]; the actual three-dimension mint
//!   is performed **downstream** by the integration layer (`Scoring_Engine` +
//!   `Minting_Service`).
//! - **Requirement 10.7**: a placeholder seam
//!   ([`RetroactiveReviewModule::anchor_outcome`]) anchors the review status + vote
//!   result to L1 (real settlement write wired in task 18.1).
//!
//! ## Decoupling from `AntiFraud_Engine` / `Governance_Module` (Requirement 10.4)
//!
//! Requirement 10.4 (apply high-intimacy exclusion + curMerit weighting in the retro
//! vote) is realised by `AntiFraud_Engine::select_voters` (exclude intimacy > 0.9,
//! sample ≥ 7 stakeholders) and `Governance_Module` weighted voting (curMerit-weighted,
//! ZK-private). To avoid tight coupling and concurrent-edit risk, this module does
//! **not** import or drive those modules: it takes the **already-tallied** weighted
//! approval ratio as an input to
//! [`resolve_vote`](RetroactiveReviewModule::resolve_vote). The integration layer (task
//! 20.1) selects voters and tallies the ZK-private weighted vote, then calls
//! `resolve_vote`.
//!
//! ## Independence from `recording.rs`
//!
//! `recording.rs` defines its own minimal `EvidenceRef` (just `uri`/`hash`) for the
//! standard recording flow. The retroactive module needs the extra *replayability*
//! semantics (Requirement 10.2/10.8), so it defines its **own** [`EvidenceRef`] here
//! rather than importing across modules. The two are deliberately separate types.
