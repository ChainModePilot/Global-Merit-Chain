//! `L2_Rollup` — pure-logic model of the ZK Rollup L2 high-frequency layer.
//!
//! Per the design's *L1/L2 分层架构集成* section, the **L2_Rollup** layer is a ZK
//! Rollup responsible for high-frequency processing: contribution-record creation,
//! real-time MeriToken computation and intimacy updates, returning a computation
//! result within a 5-second SLA (Requirement 13.2). It batches that work and submits a
//! batch zero-knowledge proof to L1 whenever **1,000 records** accumulate **or 60
//! seconds** elapse since the last batch — whichever comes first (Requirement 13.3) —
//! the entry point being `Recording_Service.submitRollupBatch` (Requirement 9.7). The
//! L2 runs a BFT-class consensus with block finality ≤ 3 seconds (Requirement 13.7).
//!
//! ## Why this is a pure-logic abstraction (not a real ZK rollup)
//!
//! `gmc-core` is intentionally dependency-free (task 1.1): it must compile and be
//! testable without any Substrate / ZK / proving-system crates so the very same logic
//! can be reused by both the L1 pallet and the L2 rollup. Accordingly this module
//! models **the batch-trigger decision and the per-record processing seam** as a
//! deterministic, in-memory state machine ([`L2Rollup`]). The real ZK Rollup is a thin
//! wrapper that:
//!
//! - executes the actual `Scoring_Engine` + `Minting_Service` + intimacy update for
//!   each record (here modeled by [`L2Rollup::process_contribution`], which threads a
//!   pre-computed amount through and returns a [`ComputationResult`] synchronously);
//! - generates a real zero-knowledge proof over the batched state transition (here a
//!   [`BatchProof`] placeholder + a deterministic model [`BatchRoot`]);
//! - submits `(batch_root, proof)` to L1 for verification (here the decoupled
//!   [`L1ProofSink`] seam);
//! - runs a real BFT engine honouring the ≤ 3 s finality budget (here the
//!   [`L2Consensus`] marker).
//!
//! Where this module says "model" / "stand-in" / "budget", the production rollup
//! substitutes the corresponding real primitive; the **batch-trigger arithmetic**
//! ([`L2Rollup::should_submit_batch`] / [`L2Rollup::try_submit_batch`]) is, however,
//! the real protocol logic and is what Property 29 (task 19.3) verifies.
//!
//! ## Latency & finality budgets (Requirements 13.2, 13.7)
//!
//! These are documented **SLAs**, not something the pure-logic model can enforce by
//! itself (it returns immediately): [`COMPUTE_LATENCY_BUDGET_SECS`] = 5 s is the
//! deadline within which [`process_contribution`](L2Rollup::process_contribution) must
//! return a computation result on the real L2; [`L2Consensus::finality_budget_secs`]
//! = [`BFT_FINALITY_BUDGET_SECS`] = 3 s is the block-finality budget the real BFT
//! engine honours.
//!
//! ## Decoupling from the concurrently-edited L1 module (the [`L1ProofSink`] seam)
//!
//! The L2→L1 submission boundary is modeled with the [`L1ProofSink`] **trait defined
//! here**, so this module does **not** import the `l1_settlement` module (authored /
//! edited concurrently) nor any of its internals. [`try_submit_batch`] produces a
//! self-contained [`Batch`] value `{ records, batch_root, proof }`; the integration
//! task (20.1) implements [`L1ProofSink`] over the real `L1Settlement` (whose
//! `submit_batch_proof` guard — verify proof, update the state root on success, retain
//! the previous root on failure — is task 18.2, Requirement 13.8) and hands the batch
//! to it. [`L2Rollup::submit_batch_proof_to`] is the convenience that wires a produced
//! batch into any [`L1ProofSink`].
//!
//! ## Sharding scale-out & ZK voter privacy (task 19.2)
//!
//! Two further L2-layer concerns are modeled at the bottom of this module:
//!
//! - **Sharding scale-out (Requirement 13.5)** — when the network-wide submission rate
//!   stays above the in-use instances' combined rated throughput for > 60 s, parallel
//!   rollup instances are added until the total rated throughput covers the rate. The
//!   single-instance [`L2Rollup`] above models *one* shard's batching; the
//!   [`ShardController`] layered on top owns N parallel instances and captures the
//!   **scale-out decision arithmetic** ([`ShardController::observe_rate`] /
//!   [`required_instances`]). Real elastic provisioning is infrastructure; this module
//!   captures only the deterministic, unit-testable decision.
//! - **ZK voter privacy (Requirement 11.7)** — [`PublicVoteResult`] models the privacy
//!   property: from a private [`VoteTally`] only the *aggregate outcome* (pass/fail and
//!   approval ratio) is published; per-voter identities are never part of the public
//!   view. The real ZK proof attests the tally without revealing ballots.
