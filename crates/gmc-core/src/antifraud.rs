//! `AntiFraud_Engine` — high-intimacy exclusion, sampling, anomaly detection, clawback.
//!
//! This module implements the design's `AntiFraud_Engine` voter-selection step (see
//! the design document's *Components and Interfaces* + flow 3 "事后申报审核投票", and
//! blueprint ch.6 §6.3 / §6.5 "排除高亲密度者 + 随机抽样"). Task 12.1 covers **voter
//! selection only**:
//!
//! 1. **Exclude high-intimacy entities** (Requirement 11.1): within the normalized
//!    intimacy interval `[0, 1]`, drop every stakeholder whose intimacy with the
//!    contributor is **strictly greater than `0.9`**. This is the core defence
//!    against "自己人给自己人投票" (insiders voting for insiders).
//! 2. **Random sampling** (Requirement 11.2): from the remaining stakeholders, draw a
//!    voter set whose size is **at least 7** and **at most the remaining count**.
//! 3. **Insufficient stakeholders** (Requirement 11.3): if fewer than 7 remain after
//!    exclusion, defer the vote, return [`GmcError::StakeholderInsufficient`], and
//!    mint nothing (the caller performs no minting on `Err`).
//!
//! ## Determinism & the seeded PRNG
//!
//! Production randomness for voter sampling is ultimately sourced from on-chain
//! randomness / a VRF and wired at the L1/L2 integration layer. At this **pure-logic**
//! layer we keep sampling *deterministic and dependency-free* by driving it from a
//! caller-supplied `u64` seed through a small inline [`SplitMix64`] PRNG. This keeps
//! the logic reproducible — the same `(stakeholders, sample_size, seed)` always yields
//! the same voter set — which is exactly what the Property 24 test (task 12.3) needs,
//! and avoids adding the `rand` crate as a dependency. The integration layer supplies
//! a real unpredictable seed; the selection *algorithm* it feeds is the one below.
//!
//! ## Anomaly detection (Requirement 11.4)
//!
//! Beyond voter *selection*, this module also implements **anomalous voting-behaviour
//! detection** (task 12.2): when a voter, within the most recent **30-day** evaluation
//! window, casts **≥ 5** approve votes toward a single object **and** those approvals
//! make up **strictly more than 80%** of all of that voter's votes toward that object,
//! the behaviour is flagged and recorded as a *pending-audit* entry. See
//! [`detect_anomaly`] and [`AntiFraudEngine`].
//!
//! ## Scope boundaries (other 11.x parts live elsewhere)
//!
//! - **Post-hoc collusion clawback** (Requirement 11.6) is a later unit-test task.
//! - **ZK voter-identity privacy** (Requirement 11.7) is applied above this layer at
//!   the L2 integration (task 19.2); here voters are plain [`FayID`]s so the selection
//!   math can be expressed deterministically.
