//! `Evaluation_Mechanism` — per-chain evaluation config and change governance.
//!
//! This module implements the **evaluation mechanism model + config validation**
//! (task 5.1). Each `Nested_Merit_Chain` stores its own independent
//! [`EvaluationMechanism`] (Requirement 3.1), held in an [`EvaluationMechanismSlot`]
//! so the registry can model "defined here" vs. "inherit from an ancestor"
//! (`null` in the design data model, Requirement 3.2).
//!
//! ## What a valid config requires (Requirements 3.3, 3.6)
//!
//! An [`EvaluationMechanism`] is accepted **iff** both hold:
//!
//! 1. it declares **at least one** contribution-acquisition mode
//!    ([`AcquisitionMode`]: objective metering, bounty task, or both), and
//! 2. its consensus pass-threshold lies in the half-open interval `(0, 1]` —
//!    strictly greater than 0% and at most 100%.
//!
//! Note that [`Ratio`] already constrains values to the closed interval `[0, 1]`, so
//! the type system rules out the upper bound (`> 1` is unrepresentable). The `(0, 1]`
//! rule therefore reduces, at this layer, to *additionally rejecting exactly `0`*.
//! The [`EvaluationMechanism::from_threshold_decimal`] constructor accepts a raw
//! [`Decimal`] and rejects any value outside `(0, 1]` (including `> 1`) up front.
//!
//! When a config is rejected the previous valid config must be preserved
//! (Requirement 3.6). This is modelled by [`EvaluationMechanismSlot::try_set`], which
//! validates first and only replaces the stored config on success — a failed update
//! returns [`GmcError::MechanismConfigInvalid`] and mutates nothing. The standalone
//! constructors are pure: they return `Err` without touching any stored state.
//!
//! ## High-intimacy exclusion (Requirement 3.5)
//!
//! Every mechanism carries an [`EvaluationMechanism::exclude_high_intimacy`] flag that
//! defaults to `true` ([`DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_HIGH_INTIMACY`]), reusing the existing
//! stakeholder-voting + high-intimacy-exclusion rules enforced by `AntiFraud_Engine`.
//!
//! ## Governance-threshold-gated change flow (task 5.2)
//!
//! A change to a chain's [`EvaluationMechanism`] only takes effect after it reaches
//! the chain's own governance threshold (Requirement 3.4); a change that does not
//! reach the threshold is rejected with [`GmcError::GovernanceThresholdNotMet`] and
//! the existing config is preserved unchanged (Requirement 3.7). This is implemented
//! by [`EvaluationMechanismSlot::propose_change`] /
//! [`EvaluationMechanismSlot::propose_change_from_parts`], which take the chain's
//! governance outcome as an explicit [`GovernanceDecision`] input.
//!
//! ### Governance decision is an input, not a dependency
//!
//! The pure-logic core models the governance vote *result* as the caller-supplied
//! [`GovernanceDecision`] value rather than calling the `Governance_Module` directly.
//! This keeps `mechanism` free of any compile/runtime dependency on the (separately
//! authored) governance engine; the real wiring — running the weighted vote, applying
//! the chain's threshold, and protecting voter identity — happens at the integration
//! layer (tasks 18.1 / 20.x), which translates a `Governance_Module` tally into a
//! [`GovernanceDecision`] before invoking the change flow here.
//!
//! ### L1 anchoring seam (Requirement 3.8)
//!
//! When a change is applied, the flow returns a [`MechanismChangeReceipt`] marking
//! that the now-effective change must be **anchored to L1_Settlement**. The real
//! anchoring is wired in task 18.1; this receipt is the documented seam the
//! integration layer consumes to perform the settlement-layer write. No L1 anchoring
//! is performed at this pure-logic layer.
