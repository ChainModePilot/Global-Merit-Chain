//! Example/unit tests for the `Scoring_Engine` three-dimensional classification
//! (task 8.7). These are concrete worked examples — **not** one of the numbered design
//! properties (Property 1–30), so they deliberately carry no `Feature: ... Property N`
//! label.
//!
//! They exercise [`ScoringEngine::classify`], the dimension-count + proportion validator
//! that every classification result must pass (Requirements 6.2–6.4 happy paths plus the
//! 6.6 / 6.7 error paths):
//!
//! - 科研 (research) → [`Dimension::Thought`]            (Requirement 6.2)
//! - AI 训练 (AI training) → [`Dimension::Training`]     (Requirement 6.3)
//! - 手艺 (craft / skill) → [`Dimension::Technique`]      (Requirement 6.4)
//! - 无法归入任一维度 → [`GmcError::DimensionUnmatched`]  (Requirement 6.6)
//! - 占比之和 ≠ 100% → [`GmcError::WeightSumInvalid`]      (Requirement 6.7)
//!
//! `classify` validates a *proposed* classification (the concrete Evaluation_Mechanism
//! that decides which dimension a contribution belongs to is wired in by a later
//! integration task). Each happy-path example therefore models a contribution that the
//! mechanism would place into a single dimension at 100% weight, and asserts the engine
//! accepts it and preserves exactly that dimension.
