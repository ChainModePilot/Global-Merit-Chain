//! Property 5 (`Feature: gmc-core-protocol`) — **每条链至少一个 Steward**.
//!
//! For any successfully created `Nested_Merit_Chain`, its `stewards` set contains at
//! least one Steward identifier (_design Correctness Properties, Property 5;
//! Requirement 2.4_).
//!
//! This is the single numbered property test for Property 5. It drives a
//! [`ChainRegistry`] (seeded with a controlled, single-steward `GMC_Base` root) with a
//! generated sequence of [`DeriveRequest`]s. Most requests carry a generated
//! **non-empty** steward vector (`1..=4` stewards); a fraction carry an **empty**
//! steward vector. The empty-steward requests confirm the rejection side of the rule:
//! `Chain_Registry::derive` (through `NestedMeritChain::new`) returns an error and
//! creates **no** chain. After replaying the whole sequence, every chain present in
//! the registry other than the controlled root — i.e. every chain that was
//! *successfully created* via `derive` — must carry at least one Steward.
