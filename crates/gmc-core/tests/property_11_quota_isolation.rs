//! Property 11 — 配额逐链隔离 (per-chain quota isolation).
//!
//! This is the dedicated property-based test for **Property 11** of the
//! `gmc-core-protocol` design's *Correctness Properties* section (task 6.6).
//!
//! > **Property 11: 配额逐链隔离** — *对任意* 涉及多条链的交错铸造请求序列，任一条链的
//! > `mintedThisPeriod` 仅由对该链的铸造决定，对其它链的铸造不改变本链的可用配额。
//!
//! **Validates: Requirements 4.6**
//!
//! ## Approach
//!
//! Per [`gmc_core::quota::QuotaLedgerSet`], each [`ChainId`] maps to its *own*
//! `(QuotaConfig, QuotaLedger)` pair, and `consume` routes to exactly one entry. The
//! isolation claim is therefore: driving an **interleaved** multi-chain mint sequence
//! through one shared [`QuotaLedgerSet`] leaves each chain's `mintedThisPeriod` (and
//! its exhausted flag, i.e. its remaining available quota) **identical** to what it
//! would be if *only that chain's own* requests — in their original relative order —
//! had been applied to a standalone ledger.
//!
//! The single proptest below:
//!
//! 1. registers every chain in the generator's id pool with its own validated config,
//! 2. drives the whole interleaved sequence through the shared `QuotaLedgerSet`,
//! 3. for each chain, replays **only that chain's** ops (same relative order) against a
//!    fresh standalone [`QuotaLedger`] built from the *same* config, and
//! 4. asserts the shared set and the standalone reference agree on both
//!    `mintedThisPeriod` and `is_exhausted` for that chain.
//!
//! Agreement means inter-chain mints never touched the chain's accounting — exactly
//! the per-chain isolation of Requirement 4.6. No time advance / period rollover is
//! involved (isolation is purely about mint accounting), so `reset_if_elapsed` is not
//! exercised here.
